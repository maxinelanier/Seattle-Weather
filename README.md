# Seattle-Weather
Purpose: To figure out whether it rains more in Seattle or St. Louis.
Source of data: NOAA climate data sets seattle_rain.csv and stl_rain.csv, which measure the daily precipitation in Seattle and St. Louis for the entirely of years 2017-2022. 
Links to data: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND

Analysis: Data sets were combined and cleaned in Data_Preparation_.ipynb by filling in missing values, selecting relevent subsets of the data, and deriving new variables. The resulting data set was used in analysis.ipynb to create charts that compare the amount of rain in inches and time spend raining between St. Louis and Seattle.
